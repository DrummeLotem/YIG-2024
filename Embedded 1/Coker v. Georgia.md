# 433 U.S. 584

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/433/584/

### Summary

A man broke out of prison, stole a car, and raped Elnita Carver. At this point, he was sentenced to death. 
Despite this, the court ruled that "Sentencing a defendant to death for committing rape violates the Eighth Amendment." (see [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|cruel and unusual punishment]].)

* For Carter
	* "unconstitutional to inflict a punishment that is grossly disproportionate to the crime or does not contribute to legitimate goals of punishment." 
	*  60 years is exceedingly excessive.
* For State
	* Overt
