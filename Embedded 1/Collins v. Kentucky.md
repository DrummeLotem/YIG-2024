## 234 U.S. 634

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/234/634/

### Summary

### Use
* Pretty classic [[Important Quirbs#^802bce|vagueness doctrine]] fare. Could support Carter, as it mentions 
	"state penal statute which prescribes no standard of conduct that it is possible to know violates the fundamental principles of justice embodied in the conception of due process of law.
* Could also support state, as the law is very specific in saying "1000 feet"
### Embedded Case Law
[[International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky]]
