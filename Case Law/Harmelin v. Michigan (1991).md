## 501 U.S. 957 (1991)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/957/

### Summary
(This one's a doozy)

After claiming life in prison for possessing 650 grams of crack was "cruel and unusual," Harmelin was declined a change in sentencing.
Essentially, the claim of [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|cruel and unusual punishment]] was denied on the basis of being too vague.
	They shot down a test described in Solem v. Helm and Rummel v. Estelle!!!
5 points of cruel and unusual punishment:
	1. It is up to the courts to assign prison terms for *specific* crimes.
	2. There are many different aspects of imprisonment, and all are included in the 8th amendment.
	3. There will always be differences in recommended and delivered sentencing.
	4. Proportionality *must* be objective
	5. Strict proportionality is not required, there simply can't be grossly disproportionate punishments.


### Use

* For State:
	* "There are no adequate textual or historical standards to enable judges to determine whether a particular penalty is disproportional.
	* In the event that [[Coker v. Georgia]] is cited, mention the quote that "death is different" and requires further protection.
* For Carter
	* 650 grams of heroin is a **huge** amount. It indicates premediated action. In Carter's case, he only had 1.5 grams, and it was simply to pay rent, not as a result of major drug trafficking.
	* "Between 32,500 and 65,000 doses" compared to the measly 12-120 possessed by Carter.
