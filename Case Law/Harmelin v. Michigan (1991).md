## 501 U.S. 957 (1991)

https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/957/

### Summary
(This one's a doozy)

After claiming life in prison for possessing 650 grams of crack was "cruel and unusual," Harmelin was declined a change in sentencing.
Essentially, the claim of [[Important Quirbs#^ce25e2|cruel and unusual punishment]] was denied on the basis of being too vague.
	They shot down a test described in Solem v. Helm and Rummel v. Estelle!!!


### Use

* For State:
	* "There are no adequate textual or historical standards to enable judges to determine whether a particular penalty is disproportional"
	* 
	* In the event that [[Coker v. Georgia]] is cited, 
* For Carter
	* 650 grams of heroin is a **huge** amount. It indicates premediated action. In Carter's case, he only had 1.5 grams, and it was simply to pay rent, not as a result of major drug trafficking.
